The client wanted open spaces so I tried to accomplish that by having a wide open living area. I tried to separate the areas in the living area by their furniture and the rugs underneath them. I chose a light grey blue as the wall color (this matches closest to the elemental color on the swatch-board). I made sure the house had three bedrooms and two and a half baths which were per the client's request.  

For my swatch-board I went to Lowe's to find paint color and material samples, and I was able to find a maple wood sample (which would be the main flooring throughout the living area and kitchen) and some paint colors, but I was not able to find any carpet samples or tile samples. I took pictures of some materials I could not find samples for mainly black granite (for the kitchen and bathroom counter-tops) and travertine (for the bathroom floors). Due to this my swatch board is partially physical and partially digital. Though it is not on the swatch board I plan to have white cabinetry for the kitchen and bathrooms.

As the client requested I tried to keep to: mainly neutral colors, having a big kitchen, and having a moderately large family gathering area for the house size and number of bedrooms. I believe, I also accomplished a traditional style.

The client and I looked at some photos of different kitchens that could act as inspiration for the design and I tried to make sure I matched her taste in kitchen style.

Overall I think the design was a success and made great use of open space, but still allowed for separation between different rooms.
